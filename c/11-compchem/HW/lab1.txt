1.  Explain the units that NAMD works with.  Consider:
	a) distances
	b) energies
	c) pressures
	d) temperatures

2.  E-mail the two renders of ubiquitin in the water box and water sphere to Lucas (lwagner@uci.edu).
	(This is Step 10 of "Solvation" in Lab Lesson 1).

3.  In step 4 of "Basic Analysis", we make a plot of the temperature.  After completing the "Basics of Grace",
do steps 1 through 4 of Basic Analysis again.  In the plot window, hit "File -> Export to Xmgrace".  In xmgrace,
fix up the plot (title, axis labels), give it the proper units and print it out to turn it in.  (Recall the steps
used in "Basics of Grace".)  Then answer these questions:

	a) Why isn't the temperature at the value 310K that was specified in the configuration file?
            (Hint:  see p. 21 of the NAMD walkthrough.)
	b) What is going on for the first 100 time steps?  (Hint: see p. 15 of the NAMD walkthrough.)

4.  After plotting the RMSD values (in "Basics of Grace"), print out the plot and turn it in.  Also answer 
the following questions.

	a) Why does one of the data sets have a higher RMSD than the other?
	b) Has the system equilibrated?  What indicates (or what would indicate) that the system has equilibrated?
	c) How would you test if you have enough water to simulate the system properly?
