Lab 4:

Key:  * - need to do in lab.  


Please read each question completely before following any instructions.


1.*  Basis set convergence.  Open up Tmolex 3.0 by typing in "tmolex3" into the terminal.
You may need to create a new project directory for this updated program besides the older 
one.  Start with two Hydrogen atoms, 1.4 bohr radii apart.  Let's try and find the
converged answer to the energy and equilibrium bond length, independent of the basis set.
To do this, we'll run calculations with increasingly better basis sets.
	a*) Run HF geometry optimization in the ground state for five basis sets:  def2-SVP, 
	  def2-TZVP, def2-TZVPP, def2-QZVP, and def2-QZVPP.  Make sure to name your jobs very
	  descriptively, e.g. H2_GEO_def2-TZVP, since we're doing GEOmetry optimization for
	  specific basis sets.  For each calculation, record the number of basis functions in 
	  each set (found in the Atomic Attributes tab), the equilibrium bond length (found 
	  in the Geometry tab), and the energy (in Results).
	b) Has the energy converged to the "basis set limit"?  What's your best guess
	  for the basis set limit for the minimum energy and the equilibrium bond length?

2.*  Binding energy curve.  Find a few points on the HF binding energy curve for H2.  We'll
try and calculate the vibrational energy for H2 in HF theory, using the def2-TZVP basis set.
So, create some new jobs with Hydrogens at varying bond lengths.  Choose a few around the 
equilibrium position:  1.35, 1.38, 1.4, 1.42, and 1.45.  (It's helpful to choose units of au, 
atomic units, on the Geometry tab, so that what numbers you end up seeing and what you entered in are 
the same.)  The easiest thing to do to create a new job is to change the basis set, and it will 
create a new project in the TmoleXProject window.  But always change the basis back to def2-TZVP.  
Then when you hit "Run (local)", it will ask you to save it as something, and save it as 
something descriptive.  Record the energies for each of these lengths.

3.*  Let's calculate the vibrational energy of the H2 molecule, again using HF theory, using
TmoleX.  Start with the optimized Geometry found in problem 1 for the def2-TZVP basis set.
Then go through all the usual tabs (Atomic Attributes = def2-TZVP, Molecular Attributes, 
and Method = Hartree Fock).  Then on "Start Job", use "Spectra & Excited States --> IR & 
vibrational frequencies."  Then hit "Run (local)."  Save the job as "H2_vibration."
	a*) Record the zero point vibrational energy of the molecule, the SCF-energy, and
	  the SCF + E(vib0) energy.  
	b) On the total molecular energy curve, the SCF-energy corresponds to the deepest 
	  part of the well, which is related to the well-depth.  By analogy, what does the 
	  SCF + E(vib0) energy correspond to?  Compare the well-depth and dissociation energy
	  of the HF solution to the exact answer.
	c*) What is the content of the "vibrational modes" section?  What is the value (in 
	  wavenumbers) of the nonzero mode?
	d) Explain why there are 6 modes, but only one nonzero.  Think about degrees of freedom.
	  This site should be useful:  
	  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)#Example:_diatomic_gas
	e) Compare the value of the nonzero vibrational mode (from part c) and the zero point 
	  vibrational energy of the molecule (from part a).

4.  This problem can be done at home.  Let's calculate the zero point vibrational energy
for the nuclei, given the energies we found in problem 2.  Make an Excel spreadsheet with 
the bond length (1.35, 1.38, etc.) in one column, and the corresponding energies in another.
	a) Turn in a graph of Energy vs. bond length.  Remember to label axes and title descriptively.
	b) Fit a second-order polynomial to the data.  Show this on the same plot as in part (a).  
	  The fit line should look like
		E(R) = a R^2 + b R + c.
	  (Probably where E = y and x = R.)  Record your values for a, b, and c.
	c) Find the corresponding values for k, R0, and E0 if we convert the expression in (b) to:
		E(R) = 0.5 k ( R - R0 )^2 + E0,
	  where k is an effective spring constant holding the nuclei together.
	d) The mass of a proton (a hydrogen atom) is M = 1836 times more massive than the 
	  electron.  Use the reduced mass of diatomic Hydrogen, mu = M / 2, to calculate 
	  the harmonic oscillator energy:
	 	omega = sqrt(  k / mu  ).
	  Convert from a.u. to wavenumber (cm^{-1}).
	e) Compare omega with the values found by the computer in problem 3.  How does the
	  computer calculate the vibrational energy?
	f) How does the HF vibrational energy compare to the exact vibrational energy?
