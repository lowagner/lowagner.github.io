HW3:  LCAO Basis functions and how they work
** means double points
All formulas are in atomic units.

1. Consider a simple Gaussian basis function, chi(r)=C exp(-r^2/2).  
Normalize it, i.e., choose C so that int d^3r |chi^2| = 1.

Hint: alpha=1/2 in the notation of the lecture, so use the formula
there to deduce C.

2. Use chi as a trial wavefunction for the hydrogen atom to estimate
its energy.  What is the percentage error?  Plot phi and the exact wavefunction.
Calculate the overlap between your approximate wavefunction and the exact one.

Hint:  In atomic units, the exact wavefunction is exp(-r)/pi^1/2.

3. Repeat #1 for Gaussian A with exp(-r^2/4) and Gaussian B for exp(-2r^2), i.e.,
Calculate C_A and C_B by requiring normalization.  Find the value of the overlap integral.

Hint:  Again, the normalization constants can be found from the lecture, noticing alpha=1/4
for A and 2 for B.  All the matrix elements for this problem can be found with the formulas
at the bottom of this page.   Here a=1/4, b=2, so c = (9/8)^2, so S=(32/81)^3/4.

4.** Find the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom in your basis set
of two Gaussians.

Hint:  Again, use formulas at bottom of page, rather than calculating the integrals
yourselves.

5.** Solve the 2x2 eigenvalue problem to get the ground-state wavefunction and energy
in this basis.  Plot with the exact wavefunction and your previous estimate.
What is the new percentage error and overlap with the exact wavefunction?

Hint: This means find both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  This is a generalized eigenvalue problem, because
of the overlap.  You must solve det(H-SE) = 0, where H is the Hamiltonian matrix and S is the overlap
matrix.  The roots are the eigenvalues and the vectors that satisfy (H-SE).c=0 are the eigenfunctions.

6. What does the other eigenstate and energy correspond to?  Plot the
wavefunction and comment on the accuracy of its energy.

Hint: Compare with another exact wavefunction of the H-atom.

7.**  In the minimal basis set of a single 1s orbital for each H atom,
the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian and overlap are, in atomic units:
s=(1+R+R^2/3)*exp(-R), HAA=-1/2 -1/R + (1+1/R)*xp(-2R), and 
HAB=-s/2-(1+R)*exp(-R)
Plot each of these as a function of R and explain their behavior as R gets
very small and very large.

8. For the previous question, diagonalize the Hamiltonian and plot the eigenvalues as function of R.
Also plot the binding energy curve as a function of R, giving the well-depth bond
length and vibrational frequency, and compare with
reference data.  How could you improve the calculation?

Hint; Repeat the procedure you used for the two Gaussians.  Its exactly the same math.

9. From reading 3.2-3.9, give a definition for each of the following terms:
self-consistency (86), Fock operator(91), Roothaan-Hall equations (94), ROHF (99), SCF convergence (101),
direct minimization (103), spin contamination(106), direct SCF(108), divide
and conquer(111).


Helpful formulas for a single atom
For two Gaussians of decay constants a and b, eg phi(r)=(2a/pi)^(3/4)*exp(-a*r^2)
S = (ab/c)^(3/4), where c=((a+b)/2)^2
V = -4*(ab)^(3/4)/(sqrt(pi))*(a+b)), where v=-1/r
T = (3/4)*(ab)^(7/4)/c^(5/4)
