1. Read the following sections of Jensen chap 5: 5.1-2, 5.4,5.4.1, 5.4.4, 5.4.6.For each of the following, give a definition (in your own words) and
an example:  the number of zeta's of a basis function, polarization
functions, diffuse functions, contraction, Pople-type basis set,
Ahlrichs type basis set.

Read DFT in a nutshell to answer next questions.

2. Answer the following:
 a. What was wrong with the TF approach to DFT?
 b. In a KS calculation, which is the only unknown part of the energy
 that must be approximated?
 c. Name three approximate XC functionals.
 d. What are hybrid functionals?
 e. Does regular KS-DFT give electronic excitations?

3. Do the review questions (first 6).

4. Use formula (11) and apply it to a harmonic oscillator with
1 particle and k=1 (atomic units) and to a particle in a box.
To do this, calculate the ground-state probability density and
kinetic energy exactly, and then get the approximate kinetic
energy from Eq (11).  Report the percentage errors, including their
sign.
