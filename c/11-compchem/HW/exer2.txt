Lecture Exercises

Questions (* counts triple):

1. What are the 6 generic types of contributions to the energy in a FF model, and which are bonding, which are non-bonding, and which are cross terms? (2.2)

2*. For which bending energy, CH4 or H2O, is the harmonic approximation moreaccurate (Figs 2.4 and 2.5)?  Make a plot of the harmonic approximation and the exact data for H2.  Is the harmonic approximation good (errors below 10%) for energies up to 40 kJ/mol above the minimum?

3*. Find parameters for a torsional energy (eq. 2.10) to model the rotational barrier of ethane (set the lowest energy to zero).

4*. The value of C6 for H2 is 6.499 in atomic units.  Plot both the exact and Lennard-Jones potentials for H2, and plot the % error for LJ for R > 3A.

5. Why are electrostatic interactions so much more important for polar molecules (Sec 2.2.6)?

6. In table 2.3, explain (a) why there are so many more parameters needed for bending than for stretching and (b) why such a small fraction are actually in MM2.  Repeat for torsional parameters relative to stretches.

7. What is the danger in using estimated 'generic' parameters? (2.3.1)

8. Explain the difference between Class I and Class II/III FFs (2.4).  Give one example of each.

9. Why must you use a cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions?  Since these are usually short-ranged, why can't it be, say, 5A? (2.5)

10. Using Table 2.4, compare the three popular force fields, AMBER, CHARM, and MM2 in terms of (a) speed, (b) accuracy, and (c) types of systems applied to.
