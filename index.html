Here shall begin all the very important
updates to life and other things.
This should always be up to date and
not have any irrelevant unimportant objects
on it.  This is definitely not repeating
the same redundant statements over and over
and over, but rather it is simply making
it very clear that this website is for
only very good and useful purposes.

Sometimes the purpose of these git commits
is to show that there is progress being made
and to document and track those progresses
in the name of progress and moving forward.
